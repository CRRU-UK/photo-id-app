The Photo ID app is a research tool that can be used for photo-identification methodologies in longitudinal mark-recapture studies. It allows for the organisation and matching of photographs containing unique identification markings (such as dorsal fins of cetaceans). It includes tools for editing and visually filtering photographs to help with identification of marks.

The documentation is a work-in-progress.
