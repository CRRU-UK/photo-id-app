description: How the app handles your data.

This policy describes how the app handles data, including optional telemetry.

## Data stored on your device

All project data, photos, and settings remain on your computer. The app does not upload your projects, photos, or identification data to any server unless you explicitly choose to enable telemetry (see below).

- **Project files** (`.photoid`) and thumbnails are stored in the folders you choose.
- **Recent projects** are stored locally for quick access.
- **Settings** are stored in your system application data directory.

## Optional telemetry (error reporting)

Telemetry is **disabled by default**. If you enable it in Settings, the app may send the following to _Sentry_ (a third‑party error-reporting service) to help us fix bugs:

- **Crash reports** – When the app crashes, diagnostic information (stack traces, system info) is sent.
- **Error details** – When unexpected errors occur, we receive error messages and context.
- **Performance data** – Timing and performance metrics to help identify slow operations.
- **Session recordings on errors** – When an error occurs, a recording of the UI state at that moment may be captured. Recordings are **not** captured continuously; only when something goes wrong. Text, images, and canvas elements (used for displaying photos in the photo editor) are blocked and masked and are not included.
- **Console logs** – Log messages (log, warn, error) may be attached to error reports for debugging.

All telemetry is sent only when you have enabled it in [settings](./user-guide/usage.md#settings). You can disable it at any time, however a restart of the app may be required for the change to take effect.

## Data processing and retention

- **Processor**: Sentry, Inc. (USA) processes telemetry data on our behalf. Sentry is GDPR-compliant and offers [data processing terms](https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/) for EU users.
- **Retention**: We configure Sentry to retain error and telemetry data only for as long as needed (90 days).
- **No sale of data**: We do not sell, rent, or trade your data to third parties.

## Your rights

If you are in the UK or European Economic Area, you have rights under data protection law, including:

- The right to access data we hold about you
- The right to request correction or deletion
- The right to object to processing
- The right to withdraw consent (e.g. by disabling telemetry)

To exercise these rights or ask questions about data handling, please contact us at [info@crru.org.uk](mailto:info@crru.org.uk).

We may update this privacy policy. The current version is always available at [photoidapp.crru.org.uk/privacy/](https://photoidapp.crru.org.uk/privacy/).
