To download and install the app, go to the latest release on app's GitHub page:

[github.com/CRRU-UK/photo-id-app/releases/latest](https://github.com/CRRU-UK/photo-id-app/releases/latest)

Then, depending on your platform, download and open the appropriate file from the release page:

- **Windows:** [Photo.ID-{{ version }}.Setup.exe](blah)
- **macOS:** [Photo.ID-darwin-arm64-{{ version }}.zip](blah)
  - Note: this is currently working as it is unsigned, and will be fixed in the future

## Auto-updates

The app will auto-update when there are new releases, so there is no need to download and install newer versions.
