---

To download and install the app, go to the latest release on the app's GitHub page:

[github.com/CRRU-UK/photo-id-app/releases/latest](https://github.com/CRRU-UK/photo-id-app/releases/latest)

Then, depending on your platform, download the appropriate file from the release page "Assets" section:

## Platforms

### Windows

1. Download the `Photo.ID-{version}.Setup.exe` file
2. Open and run the executable to install the app
3. The app will open automatically after being installed - otherwise it can be opened from the Start menu

!!! warning

    When opening the setup executable Windows will show a "Windows protected your PC" warning. Click on "More info" and then click on "Run anyway".

### macOS

1. Download the `Photo.ID-darwin-arm64-{version}.zip` file
2. Extract the archive
3. Move the `Photo ID.app` file into your Applications folder and open it

!!! warning

    The app is currently not signed and will throw an error on opening - this will be fixed soon.

## Auto updates

The app will auto-update when there are new releases, so there is no need to download and install newer versions.

Should you wish to manually upgrade or install an older version of the app, previous releases are available on the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/CRRU-UK/photo-id-app/releases).
